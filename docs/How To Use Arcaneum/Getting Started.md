## Prerequisites

To effectively use this framework, it is expected for your development workspace to be powered by [Rojo v6.2.0](https://rojo.space/). Alongside that, an optional tool you should consider having is [Moonwave](https://upliftgames.github.io/moonwave/), which is used to document each of the systems and APIs included in the framework.

## Setting up the Environment

There are two methods of setting up your rojo project to use the Arcaneum Framework: Arcaneum as a "Foundation" or Arcaneum as a "Package".

### Arcaneum as a "Foundation"
This method is the ideal route if you're starting from scratch and don't want to deal with immediate updates. To do this, simply download the repository and use the `development.project.json` file as your `default` project file.

### Arcaneum as a "Package"
In order to use this framework in your games/projects, you will need to either download, clone, or add the repo as a submodule into a folder that represents ServerStorage in the rojo environment.
