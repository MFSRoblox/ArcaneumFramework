## Why was Arcaneum made?
Arcaneum was made as a response to working in projects that quickly turned into [Big Balls of Mud.](https://thedomaindrivendesign.io/big-ball-of-mud/).

The following factors caused this to happen:

- Monolith scripts acting as a universal service composed of multiple systems within itself
    - As a result, it was hard (possibly impossible) to test those scripts
- Convoluted system interactions such that changing one system is likely to break or neglect multiple other systems
- Repeated code and systems in multiple scripts make maintaining and updating those codes a hastle

## Why should you use Arcaneum?
Arcaneum is a framework that provides modules that allow for Object Oriented Programming style code to be made. Alongside that, minor utilities are included to help manage the many services and instances that ROBLOX provides in its environment.
