Hey! This is my first post!

The next step I need to take for this framework to reach the "complete state" is the ability to add your own classes, datatypes, and services to the framework without needing to make a forked version. I plan on doing this by expanding upon the ClassService and the core Arcaneum module with methods that allow this to happen.
