I added some more functionality to ClassService so any new classes made outside of the framework can be added into it without much hastle (and still be able to be referenced in a logical way). However, for this to work, I needed to add a "self reference" for each of the classes, of which adds a new property under every class called "CoreModule." I updated each class version, and found that although the version system was useful, it was sadly hindered by the fact that all of my `CheckVersion`s weren't written in the same way so Ctrl-F could find them all. Thus I made all of them uniform, such that it follows the format of `\n (ClassName):CheckVersion()`. It made more changes A LOT easier from that point on. After this, I added the ParentClass argument to [ClassService:AddClassModule] and a new helper function of [ClassService:SetClassParent], under the case that a module would need to be moved again for whatever reason. I also added an "AddOn" section for the ClassService if a new module doesn't exactly belong under a class, but also doesn't belong under anything else outside of a class.

I'll have to experiment and test these new changes.
